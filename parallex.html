            </div>

            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paraglide: lightweight, free- flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing.
                <br><br>
                Among the health benefits of paragliding, you will also help to build a strong core, which helps with balance, posture, and stability. This aerial sport engages your deep core muscles, which strengthens your body so that it also reduces the risk of injury during exercises and activities.
